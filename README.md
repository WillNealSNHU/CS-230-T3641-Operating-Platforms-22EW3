Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

<The gaming Room is looking to develop and implement a cross platform web-based game. Game is only available on Android currently.
It is looking to expand Draw it or Lose it to other computing environments. The game itself is like the television game show “Win, Lose or Draw”. 
The application will need the ability for a DB to render images, users from one team to input information on the image, users from another team the ability to 
input information on the image as well. The game will need multiplatform usability such as Linux, Mac, Windows, iOS 15, and Android. Real scalability would implement 
the ability to play on console, mobile and operating systems, creating a cross platform experience for any user.> - What did I do well here? I touched base on scalability
and objects of aritechture that might not have been in the "Guidelines" but thought of real world application of a product. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I believe the Design Constraints and UML helped me the most. Design Constraints are not something I typically think about when working on a project. I would for a top 5 bank
and the architechture is set up by various other teams, and I simply get a story on the Jira Board and do what needs to be done. The design of the project is typically out 
of my scope. Sure I build little stuff in the very little spare time (not recently thats for sure) but the scope is so small that it's not typically an issue. The UML's help
visually see where things are getting placed. UML's are not typically needed for the scope of the projects at work, but I know they are industry standard and in order to grow
in my career I will need to better work on them.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
The Evulation and Reccomendations part of the final document/project could use some major work. I know if this was being presented to product owners and stakeholders it 
would not be acceptable. I think I wanted to do something oIS based but I am so much more familiar with Microsoft products that I went to what was comfortable.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user is the end line, it's the goal, it's who's using the product. I mention accessibility a lot in my documentation because I think it's vastly overlooked. I believe that
the user is the one who decides the value of the product. I can build something I think is fantastic but if it is not what the user needs or wants than it has no value excpt
to me. The user in this project was the player of the game. How can we excite them, how can we ensure a flawless user-experience. How can we wow them? What road blocks might
impede the user. These are all things to think about. Good software design thinks about the end user. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I think this was a top down design as far as the code went. The base was already made and the client wanted to expand on it. I think added new features like cross platform
and expanding on what they already had was in my view top-down. It was object oriented from what we can see in the code, but I think ultimately it was user-focused. As mentioned
above the user is the most important person in the whole design process. I recently read "The design of Everyday Things" by Don Norman and I think we take for granted how many 
things are made with the user in mind.
